# Unity
Unity is a cross-platform game engine that can create 2D as well as 3D games. Simulations, stories, animations, and apps can also be created using the Unity platform. 
Popular Game created with the Unity game engine includes but is not limited to
- Among Us
- Beat Saber
- Pokemon Go
- Fall Guys
- Cuphead
- Genshin Impact
- Ori and the Will of the Wisps

# Pros
- Unity has lots of cross-platform features meaning creating a game in it can be imported to almost all types of devices. This can not be said for all game engines.
- Unity is the game engine with the largest community. Many problems that a person using Unity would encounter can likely be searched up and a solution will be found from a person with a similar experience. The Unity Docs are very well documented as well.
- In general, Unity is considered one of the easier game engines to learn.
- Unity is free to use until a developer makes over 100k with its platform.
- Written in C#, a high level language that is easy to use and works well with OOP for a game, and it gets compiled into C++ making code run fast.
- Syntax is simple and easy to understand. For example
```c#
public void Start(){
    //called at start; very simple
}
public void Update(){
    //calls every frame; very simple
}
```
boiler plate code is automatically instantiated when script is created so you don't have to write it yourself!
# Cons
- Unity has certain bugs that corrupt entire folders. Make sure everything is saved.
- Unity has very a good graphics capabilities, but is overshadowed by some specific nano-3d engines like Unreal Engine.
- Unity has a large file size compared to many game engines.
- The free version of Unity comes with a splash screen when opening up the game. This splash screen is often associated with bad games because there are so many of them.
