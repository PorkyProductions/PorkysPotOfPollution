# 3D Printing
3D printing is the construction of 3-dimensional objects from models using a 3D printer. 

My opinion and POV will be based on my 3D printer the <b>Ender 3v2</b> using <b>PLA filament</b>.

# Pros
- Allow any person to create very cool looking and function objects in almost any shape imaginable. 
- Fairly simple to set up
- Large variety of free assets online ready to be printed

Very cool and feels rewarding when completing a print.
Hedgehogs can be printed with 3D printer :D

# Cons
- Takes a long time to make an object
- Many points of errors that can be hard to find the fix to
- Expensive
