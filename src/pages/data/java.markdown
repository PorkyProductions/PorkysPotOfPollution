# Java: An outdated, object oriented language for writing antiquiated, instant-legacy code.

Java is probably the worst programming language that is widely used today. Let me explain why.
For starters, its owned by [Oracle](https://oracle.com), which is criticized for being the literal definition of an evil tech corporation.

However, my biggest gripe with Java is that it forces you into object oriented programming, which is not an easy concept for people to learn. For example, check out a classic "Hello World" program

in Java:


```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        system.out.println("Hello")
    }
}

```
Compared to that of python:

```python
print("Hello")
```

or JavaScript:

```js
console.log("Hello")
```

You see, Java forces you to write 1) a class and 2) probably the most longwinded way of writing a function ever, before you can even write any code. And yes, I know its good for typesafety, which I am all for. I am in fact a loyal TypeScript user myself. However, what I like about TypeScript is that like JavaScript, it doesn't force you into Object Oriented code. Its only there if you need it.

Also, Java should have no use outside of the enterprise where these massive corporations have the spare funds to pay Oracle to use it (which you shouldnt have to do because programming shoudl be free). **_anyone who uses Java outside of the enterprise scale should be ashamed of themselves_**

# Pros:
- Good for very large, scaleable projects
- Can compile to platform independent code
- Pleasing for enterprise customers
- Runs minecraft

# Cons:
- Forces you into a way of thinking (OOP)
- Boilerplate driven
- Need JVM, JDK, and JRE to even start programming in it
- Sometimes forces end users to download JVM for older projects
- Old
- Run by oracle
  - Vendor lock-in
