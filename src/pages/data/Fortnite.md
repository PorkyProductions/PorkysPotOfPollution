# Fortnite
Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. Becoming the most popular video game of its era, it brought waves of influence among the gaming community. While originally meant to be a story campaign in Fortnite: Save the World, the largely popular mode actually came from its free-to-play battle royale mode. The game largely consists of players grabbing loot such as guns, healing items, and materials with the intent using them in combat against other players in order to become the last person alive in game.

# Pros
Fortnite was a revolutionary game in the multiplayer, battle royale game industry. Lots of content and being available for free without being pay-to-win is a big positive which cannot be said about other games.

# Cons
Fortnite's introduction into society made waves into too many people at once. The game became stale quickly and new content / updates don't seem to make the game any better. The targeted audience of kids is a prominent negative clearly trying to tug at the hearts of children to make parents spend ludicrous amounts of money on practically useless items.
