# Dark Mode
Dark mode or alternatively "Night mode" is a popular choice between all sorts of people to make their computer screen more visually appealing to them. The main difference between dark mode and the standard is the main contrasting color of the rendered images. Standard / Light mode have more white / light pixels and are generally easier to see while dark / night mode have more black / dark pixels which help a person's eyes not be blinded.

# Pros
Dark mode acts as a good alternative to light mode but it does not effectively replace it. Many users of dark mode promote it too much saying that light mode would "blind them" when this assertion is false. I mean like Google is defaultly white and it does not blind most people even grandmas that use this technology. People that say that light mode blinds them probably live in a light-tight basement with 0 light coming in and always goes on their computer with the lights off making them more sensitive to photons entering their retinas. However, most people are not hobbits living in 0 light basements, therefore their arguments are invalid and light mode is a great standard compared to dark mode.

# Cons
- It is harder to see stuff. 
- makes me sleepier
- too many hardcore fans
