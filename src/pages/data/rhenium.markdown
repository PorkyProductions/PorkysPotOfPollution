# Rhenium: The Bane of Human Existance, yet it looks pretty cool.


Rhenium is a confusing element. On one hand, it has a pretty high atomic number, and besides having no real meaning outside of your high school chemistry class, it means the atom is generally pretty big. And you know what they always say:

> _"Bigger is better"_


Anyway, Rhenium looks pretty cool too. It has a silverish-grey luster and is generally pretty pleasing to the eyes. It has a high melting point as well.

However, you have not yet discovered how Rhenium is singlehandedly causing the singularity, and the downfall of humanity as we know it. Rhenium uses its visual appeal to subvert expectations and cause people to look over it. Like, think, when's the last time you actually thought about Rhenium when thinking about the periodic table? Chances are very small. It uses this general overlook to gain its way into the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and delte the universe as we know it. Through its high melting point, it can set off a series of **_nuclear_** chain reactions leading to the end of the universe as we know it through the singularity.


# Pros:
- Looks cool
- High melting point
- High atomic number
# Cons: 
- Master of con arts
- Subverts expectations
- Is reposible for singularity
