# Electric Vehicles (EV)
Electric Vehicles are vehicles that are powered by electricity and use one or more electric motors to propell the vehicle in the direction in wants to go. 

# Pros
EVs are famous for many notable upsides. 
- EVs drastically decrease car pollution and decrease reliance on oil for regular people. 
- EVs are also notorious for countering high gas prices with low-cost electricity. 
- The famous American brand Tesla also introduces many features like auto-pilot as well as an operating system that, while is not exclusive in electric vehicles, is hard to find in other gas cars in the world. 
- Electric vehicles also do not need to rely on a gear system to build up torque meaning that it can achieve fast 0-60 speeds that gas cars have trouble reproducing.
- EVs also can reduce energy waste in the world with a multitude of techniques including but not limited to: solar panel use, a collector system, or other clean, reusable charging means.

# Cons
- EVs have a much larger charging time than regular gas cars. On top of this, the amount of miles that an EV can go without charging is much lower compared to their gas counterparts. 
- EVs are also considerably more expensive than gasoline cars due to new technology and smaller production scale for building new vehicles.
