# Almond Joy
Almond Joy is a popular candy bar produced by Hershey's that consists of the ingredients: shredded coconut, chocoland, almonds, and various sweeteners. 

# Pros
Can sometimes be better than eating nothing

# Cons
Contrary to the name Almond **_Joy_**, the candy brings no joy to me at all. First of all, it tastes awful. Coconut can go so well on so many other things that is not whatever trash an almond joy bar is. And nutrition wise, Almond Joy is no better than any other candy bar. I mean, literally any other chocolate bar would be better than getting an Almond Joy. The only time I see someone eating an Almond Joy is on Halloween when they like to think they are unique so they scarf down food they dislike to fit in. Don't eat Almond Joy, it only sparks anger in people's lives.
